Our dish is inspired by classic French flavours as traditional favourites & the comfort factor are relevant to our diners. The lamb rump is well seared to bring out plenty of flavour. It is then topped with a seeded mustard crust and oven finished to medium-rare. This gives the crust a bit of crunch which is a contrast to the softer elements of the dish. The creamed parsnip is classically seasoned with grated nutmeg & butter which gives a rich earthiness & works well with the silky texture of the lamb. The prunes are poached in brandy and add a deep rich sweetness to contrast with the savoury flavours on the plate. A simple yet rich minted jus adds a little pepper zing & the bright mint flavour lightens the palate feel and brings together all the elements of the dish.","Blue Spur Road","RD2","Hokitika","03 755-5499","www.stationsinnhokitika.co.nz","stations-inn"]
