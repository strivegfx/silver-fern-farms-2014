The ricotta from clevedon valley buffalo has a wonderful flavour and lightness and is also low in cholesterol that I thought matched well with lean red meat. The 5 spice and orange sauce is a great bridging flavour that ties the dish together.

Lamb has a tradition of being served with peas and matches well with pinot noir. I have included these flavours and used them in a more modern presentation with the peas pureed with watercress and set as panna cotta and compressing the grapes with pepper and pinot. I chose two cuts of lamb as they have contrasting textures. The medallions being lean and tender while the SILERE Merino ribs are full flavoured and gelatinous. The cuts of lamb are then infused with similar marinades and cooked at different temperatures to bring the best out of each. I find it interesting that although they have been treated with similar flavours when finished they taste quite different.","6 Adams Avenue","","Mt Maunganui","07-575 3872","www.mountbistro.co.nz","mount-bistro"],

Starting with the Sirloin, I prepare it into medallions and cold manuka smoke them before cooking them sous vide in butter and smoked paprika. I then brine the trimmings to ensure I have as little waste as possible, that is then used to make the corned beef for the reubin tortellini. It is accompanied by a beetroot and feta gratin, and mushroom and slow cooked beef goulash. For the vegetable element I have squash fondants and creamed leeks.","20 Harley Street","","Nelson","03 546 7092","www.mintdining.co.nz","mint-dining-room"],

Our dish is inspired by classic French flavours as traditional favourites & the comfort factor are relevant to our diners. The lamb rump is well seared to bring out plenty of flavour. It is then topped with a seeded mustard crust and oven finished to medium-rare. This gives the crust a bit of crunch which is a contrast to the softer elements of the dish. The creamed parsnip is classically seasoned with grated nutmeg & butter which gives a rich earthiness & works well with the silky texture of the lamb. The prunes are poached in brandy and add a deep rich sweetness to contrast with the savoury flavours on the plate. A simple yet rich minted jus adds a little pepper zing & the bright mint flavour lightens the palate feel and brings together all the elements of the dish.","Blue Spur Road","RD2","Hokitika","03 755-5499","www.stationsinnhokitika.co.nz","stations-inn"]
